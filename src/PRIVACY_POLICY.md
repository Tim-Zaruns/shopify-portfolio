# Pictify AI Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when merchants install or interact with the Pictify AI Shopify app (“App”).

By installing or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please uninstall the App.

## Information We Collect

When a merchant installs the App, Shopify provides us with access tokens and store data that the merchant authorizes during installation. Depending on the scopes granted, we may collect:

- Store contact information (store name, owner name, email, phone).
- Store settings (currency, locale, plan type, domains).
- User IDs of staff members interacting with the App.
- Billing events related to credit purchases.
- App usage logs, support conversations, and error reports.

We do **not** collect merchants’ customer payment information or any data that is outside of the scopes granted by Shopify.

## How We Use Information

We use the collected data to:

- Authenticate merchants and staff members inside the Shopify admin environment.
- Generate, store, and display AI images, credits, and associated metadata.
- Provide support, answer questions, and troubleshoot issues.
- Send transactional emails related to billing or account notifications.
- Improve the App’s performance, security, and user experience.

We do **not** sell any information to third parties.

## Sharing Information

We only share data in the following scenarios:

- **Service providers**: We rely on infrastructure vendors (e.g., hosting, databases, AI inference providers) who process information on our behalf under strict confidentiality obligations.
- **Shopify**: As required by Shopify’s platform rules, we may share diagnostic or compliance information with Shopify.
- **Legal requirements**: When required to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other legal process.

## Security

We follow industry best practices to protect information, including:

- Encryption in transit (HTTPS) for all connections to our services.
- Access controls that restrict staff access to production data.
- Auditing and monitoring of infrastructure and data access.

No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we continually evaluate and improve our safeguards.

## Merchant Rights

Merchants can review, update, or delete their data by:

1. Uninstalling the App from the Shopify Admin (revoking access immediately).
2. Contacting us using the details below to request exports or deletion.

We respond to verified requests within 30 days.

## Children’s Privacy

Our App is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us so we can remove it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page and update the “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.

This policy is effective as of 2025-11-08
